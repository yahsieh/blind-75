The problem told us to solve in O(log n) time, which means maybe we solve this problem with divide and conquer/binary search/recursive.

Was slightly stuck at trying to rotate this array back to normal and find the minimum. But copying back to correct ascending array takes O(n) time. Peeked the solution and know that we can solve this by finding out "turning points".
